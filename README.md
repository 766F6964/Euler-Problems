# Euler-Problems

## Overview

![alt text](https://projecteuler.net/images/print_page_logo.png)

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (named after [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks. -_Wikipedia_

Every problem has exactly one integer as valid solution.
For harder problems it becomes increasingly important to find an efficient solution.

## Solutions

This repository contains the solutions for the first few problems listed on the site in different programming languages, namely [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Every solution should return the result in less then 10 seconds.

### Python

All python solutions are made using Python 3 without third party libraries. The scripts should run just fine on Windows and Linux. 

### Haskell

The Haskell solutions provided are most likely far from perfect due to entry level knowledge.
